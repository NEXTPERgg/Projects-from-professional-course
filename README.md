# Projects-from-professional-course
This where my 3 best projects that I completed while I was in the professional course

Tetris is a replica of an actual tetris game that was made using native HTML CSS and JS, this is my biggest and the
project that I am most proud of.
Sure it is just a Tetris game but I loved every step of creating it, this was my last programing project since I left
My professional course.
By far this is the easiest to play test since you only have to download the tetris folder and open index.html.
I used alot of Audios from tetris99



Dollminions 2 is the sequel from a project (Dollmons) I made some Months prior to the conclusion of the 10th grade.
It was made using Dev C++ and only with the native libraries to the program.
In this project I tried to create a very simple Pokemon Style battle simulator, just some stats and 4 moves, the 
project in my opinion was really fun to do and in both Dollminions 2 and Dollmons I had the help from a friend who
actually drew the Sprites and then she converted them into ASCII art so it could be shown in the console since this 
game is just a console game where the user has to manually write down the information so the game can run.
In itself, the game is just a simple simulation of a Pokemon battle (just stats and numers nothing too complicated)
and I chose to add the ASCII art to the game because I Thought that it would give it more life than just a console...
If I were to compare the 2, the only real difference is that the code from Dollmons is spaguetti code and it's super,
Dollmons was my first real programing project so it is expected that the code for it would be a mess but Dollminions 2
came to save the day

Snake game is my least favorite of the bunch since even tho I tried to make the game run smoothly, it is still very 
"choppy" because the console is constantly writing and erasing the next sprite...
It was also made Using Dev C++ and only with native libraries to the program and it also only runs on the console.
I recommend playing on the medium map and choosing the fast speed (it is not that fast)
(large map has a bug that surged when I was playtesting the game some days ago, I remember that the large map worked fine before I submitted).
